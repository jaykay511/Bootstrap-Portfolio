        <q>
          I was ambitious, though I didn't know exactly what I was shooting for. Now I think it's one of the most
          useless questions an adult can ask a child - <em>What do you want to be when you grow up? </em> As if growing
          up is
          finite. As if at some point you become something and that's the end.
        </q>

          "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
        </h3>
        <p>
          Adults often ask this vexing and complex question to kids. Throughout elementary and middle school my answers
          varied from "Librarian" to "Professional Athlete" to "Store Clerk" - the latter because scanning barcodes
          seemed like a lot of fun.

          In high school, with the help of the guidance counselor, I realized I had an aptitude and appreciation for
          hospitality. I learned about and worked in restaurants, hotels, tour operators, etc. while pursuing my
          undergraduate degree at New York University.
        </p>
        <h3>
          "So, what do you do?"
        </h3>
        <p>
          <em>When you grow up... your major... what do you do...</em>The wording changes, but people still ask these
          questions because, well, they're trying to understand who you are. These days I'm a student again, learning
          full-stack development in order to find a position where I can utilize my experience. The goal is to find work where all my favorite things intersect: teamwork, hospitality, integrity, and joie de vivre.
        </p>

          Coding has become something I get lost in. As a detail-oriented problem-solver, getting code to work properly feels like a victory every time. I look forward to continuing to learn and adapt, just as web development continues to evolve, and using that knowledge to build wonderful things!
